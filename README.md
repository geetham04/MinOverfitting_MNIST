# Mitigation of Overfitting problem with weightdecay
### Imported all necessary libraries using keras model
### Preprocessing - MNIST dataset load, normalization, one-hot encoding
### Dataset split into training and validation set
### set the number of epochs
### Model consists of 2 hidden layers and l2 weight regularization is passed in all layers
### Trained the model
